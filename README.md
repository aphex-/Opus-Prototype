# Opus prototype 
This is a tool to generate infinite landscapes by combining noise artifacts. 
You can use the editor to create a world and use the library to import it to your own application. 
Opus prototype offers you a way to easily describe landscapes (like seen in Minecraft) 
with values that are based on pseudo random noise algorithms.

This library is used for the game: http://nuke-the-moon.itch.io/alien-ark
Created by www.nuke-the-moon.com

This repo was released in a hurry. The library is work in progress. Builds of the editor will be added soon.
